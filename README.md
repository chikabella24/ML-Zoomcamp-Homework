Assignment 1  Using the car-price dataset

Introduction to Machine learning concepts

Understanding machine learning and the problems it can solve

CRISP-DM: Organizing a successful machine learning project

Training and selecting machine learning models

Performing model validation

The libraries imported were pandas and numpy

The following questions were answered in the  jupyter notebook

Question 1 What's the version of NumPy that you installed?

Question 2:How many records are in the dataset?

Question 4: What's the number of unique Audi car models in the dataset?

Question 5: How many columns in the dataset have missing values?

Question 6:Find the median value of "Engine Cylinders" column in the dataset.

Question 6b:Next, calculate the most frequent value of the same "Engine Cylinders".

Next, calculate the most frequent value of the same "Engine Cylinders".

Now, calculate the median value of "Engine Cylinders" once again. Has it changed?

Question 7: Select all the "Lotus" cars from the dataset.

Now drop all duplicated rows using drop_duplicates method 

Get the underlying NumPy array. Let's call it X.

Compute matrix-matrix multiplication between the transpose of X and X. To get the transpose, use X.T. Let's call the result XTX.
Invert XTX.
Create an array y with values [1100, 800, 750, 850, 1300, 1000, 1000, 1300, 800].

Multiply the inverse of XTX with the transpose of X, and then multiply the result by y. Call the result w

What's the value of the first element of w?
